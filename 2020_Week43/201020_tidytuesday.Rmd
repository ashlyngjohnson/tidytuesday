This week's Tidy Tuesday data comes from the Great American Beer Festival (GABF). There are many different categories of beers and within each category a bronze, silver, or gold medal can be awarded. 


### Getting the Data
```{r, message = FALSE}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 43)

beer_awards <- tuesdata$beer_awards
```

### Exploration using a table

Being that I live in Georgia currently, I am interested to know how successful Georgia beers have been in the GABF. First, I'll use the `flextable` package to make a table of the winning Georgia beers. 

```{r}
# cleaning up the dataframe a bit and filtering for GA breweries

ga_beer_awards <- beer_awards %>%
  filter(state == "GA") %>%
  select(-state) %>%
  mutate(medal = factor(medal, levels = c("Bronze", "Silver", "Gold")), 
         brewery = str_replace(brewery, pattern = "Sweetwater Brewing Co.", replacement = "SweetWater Brewing Co.")) %>%
  arrange(medal, city, brewery, year) %>%
  rename(
    Medal = medal,
    City = city,
    Brewery = brewery,
    Beer = beer_name,
    Category = category,
    Year = year
  ) 

# getting some useful vectors for specifying rows for conditional formatting

ga_beer_awards_cities <- ga_beer_awards$City %>% unique()
ga_beer_awards_breweries <- ga_beer_awards$Brewery %>% unique()

# making the table 

ga_beer_awards_table <- ga_beer_awards %>%
  as_grouped_data(groups = c("Medal", "City", "Brewery")) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  colformat_char(j = "Year", na_str = "") %>%
  bg(j = "Beer", bg = "skyblue2") %>%
  bg(j = "Category", bg = "skyblue3") %>%
  bg(j = "Year", bg = "skyblue4") %>%
  bg(i = ~ Medal == "Bronze", bg = "#d0700e") %>%
  bg(i = ~ Medal == "Silver", bg = "lightsteelblue4") %>%
  bg(i = ~ Medal == "Gold", bg = "gold") %>%
  bg(i = ~ City %in% ga_beer_awards_cities, bg = "gray60") %>%
  bg(i = ~ Brewery %in% ga_beer_awards_breweries,
     bg = "gray88") %>%
  bold(part = "body") %>%
  fontsize(size = 16, part = "header") %>%
  fontsize(i = ~ Medal %in% c("Bronze", "Silver", "Gold"),
           size = 15) %>%
  fontsize(j = "City", size = 14) %>%
  fontsize(j = "Brewery", size = 13) %>%
  fontsize(j = c("Beer", "Category", "Year"), size = 12) %>% 
  add_header_row(values = "Award Winning Beers in Georgia", colwidths = 6) %>% 
  fontsize(i = 1, size = 20, part = "header") %>% 
  align(align = "center", part = "header") %>% 
  bold(part = "header")

### Making Final Tidy Tuesday Image

For time's sake, I'm just going to generate a short table with just the gold medal winning beers. 

```{r}
# cleaning up the dataframe a bit and filtering for GA breweries

ga_beer_awards_gold <- beer_awards %>%
  filter(state == "GA", 
         medal == "Gold") %>%
  select(-state, -medal) %>%
  mutate(brewery = str_replace(brewery, pattern = "Sweetwater Brewing Co.", replacement = "SweetWater Brewing Co.")) %>%
  arrange(city, brewery, year) %>%
  rename(
    City = city,
    Brewery = brewery,
    Beer = beer_name,
    Category = category,
    Year = year
  ) 

# getting some useful vectors for specifying rows for conditional formatting

ga_beer_awards_cities_gold <- ga_beer_awards$City %>% unique()
ga_beer_awards_breweries_gold <- ga_beer_awards$Brewery %>% unique()

# making the "gold" table 

ga_beer_awards_gold_table <- ga_beer_awards_gold %>%
  as_grouped_data(groups = c("City", "Brewery")) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  colformat_char(j = "Year", na_str = "") %>%
  bg(j = "Beer", bg = "skyblue2") %>%
  bg(j = "Category", bg = "skyblue3") %>%
  bg(j = "Year", bg = "skyblue4") %>%
  bg(i = ~ City %in% ga_beer_awards_cities, bg = "gray60") %>%
  bg(i = ~ Brewery %in% ga_beer_awards_breweries,
     bg = "gray88") %>%
  bold(part = "body") %>%
  fontsize(size = 16, part = "header") %>%
  fontsize(j = "City", size = 14) %>%
  fontsize(j = "Brewery", size = 13) %>%
  fontsize(j = c("Beer", "Category", "Year"), size = 12) %>% 
  add_header_row(values = "Gold Medal Beers in Georgia", colwidths = 5) %>%
  bg(part = "header", bg = "gold") %>% 
  fontsize(i = 1, size = 20, part = "header") %>% 
  align(align = "center", part = "header") %>% 
  bold(part = "header") %>% 
  add_footer_row(values = "Viz: @ashgjoh", colwidths = 5) %>% 
  add_footer_row(values = "Source: Great American Beer Festival", colwidths = 5) %>% 
  align(align = "right", part = "footer") %>% 
  fontsize(part = "footer", size = 11) 

# saving as image
